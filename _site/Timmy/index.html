<p>Timmy is an all black cat with green eyes and he is a bit bigger than his brother Meowgie. I think one of the reasons why Timmy is bigger is because he steals his brothers food but our vet said he's also just a naturally big cat. He also suckles on his tail once in a while which cats sometimes do when their taken away from their mother to soon.</p>
<h2>More About Timmy</h2>
<p>He is very lazy and sleeps most of the day. He is a little shy around new people but very polite. He gets scared really easily by loud noises and sudden movement. Overall Timmy is just a really sweet baby boy.</p>
<h2>Timmy's Favourite Things</h2>
<p>Timmy loves to eat, but he's not a very adventerous eater and only likes cat food. He loves to be cuddled and have his belly rubbed. He is very interested in following people into the washroom and meowing at them. He also loves to watch the birds outside the window. One time a bird got stuck in our porch and Timmy ate it.</p>

<p>Meowgie is a brown tabby cat with green eyes. He is smaller than his brother and alot more energetic. He has a small face with really big eyes like a baby.</p>
<h2>More About Meowgie</h2>
<p>Meowgie usually sleeps during the day and goes crazy at night. He likes to run around my room, sit on my head, and paw at my face while I'm trying to fall asleep. Luckily I'm a very deep sleep so he doesn't really wake me up once I'm asleep. He also likes to meow alot, probably more than any other cat I've met.</p>
<h2>Meowgie's Favourite Things</h2>
<p>Meowgie's favourite thing of all time is being kissed on the top of his head. He will let you know that he wants kisses by head butting you in the face a ton. He enjoys watching videos of birds and mice on my phone and has scratched up my screen protector to the point of replacement multiple times. He also loves to try different foods and usually tries to steal food off of my plate. His favourite foods are croissants, cereal, potato chips, and cheezies. I try not to give him salty food because it's kind of bad for cats but sometimes he really puts up a fight to get a bite of my potato chips and cheezies.</p>

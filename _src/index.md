Hello! I'm Madison and this is a site about my cats Timmy and Meowgie. They are my favourite little guys and I can't imagine what life would be like without them. 

## Meowgie & Timmy's Life Story

My mom and I adopted Meowgie and Timmy from the humane society 9 years ago when they were both just 8 weeks old. They are brothers and they were up for adoption as a bonded pair so they were a two for one deal! They were originally named Wayne and Shuster after an old canadian comedy duo. The humane society told us that they found just the two of them abandoned without their mother. It was really fun having two baby kittens but they were also really crazy. Meowgie liked to chew on toilet paper rolls for a little bit. When Meowgie and Timmy were about 2 years old we got a puppy named Moose. They were really confused and I think they thought he was some kind of weird cat and I think Moose thinks he's a cat too. They fight sometimes but Meowgie and Timmy aren't really scared of Moose and even cuddle with him sometimes. When Timmy was around 5 years old he pulled the thread out of my sewing machine and ate it, then he had to get surgery to have it removed. For a while he looked like he got a bad tummy tuck, but eventually his hair grew back and he was able to have his tummy rubbed once again. Since then they have just been really chill and happy guys.
